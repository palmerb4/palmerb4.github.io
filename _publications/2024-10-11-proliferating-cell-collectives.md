Abstract: We study the dynamics of proliferating cell collectives whose microscopic constituents’ growth is inhibited by macroscopic growth-induced stress. Discrete particle simulations of a growing collective show the emergence of concentric-ring patterns in cell size whose spatiotemporal structure is closely tied to the individual cell’s stress response. Motivated by these observations, we derive a multiscale continuum theory whose parameters map directly to the discrete model. Analytical solutions of this theory show the concentric patterns arise from anisotropically accumulated resistance to growth over many cell cycles. This Letter shows how purely mechanical processes can affect the internal patterning and morphology of cell collectives, and provides a concise theoretical framework for connecting the micro- to macroscopic dynamics of proliferating matter.
