Abstract: Dense assemblies of self-propelling rods (SPRs) may exhibit fascinating collective behaviors and anomalous physical properties that are far away from equilibrium. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the dynamics of disclination defects in 2D fluidized swarming motions of dense dry SPRs (i.e., without hydrodynamic effects) that form notable local positional topological structures that are reminiscent of smectic order. We find the deformations of smectic-like rod layers can create unique polar structures that lead to slow translations and rotations of Â±1/2-order defects, which are fundamentally different from the fast streaming defect motions observed in wet active matter. We measure and characterize the statistical properties of topological defects and reveal their connections with the coherent structures. Furthermore, we construct a bottom-up active-liquid-crystal model to analyze the instability of polar lanes, which effectively leads to defect formation between interlocked polar lanes and serves as the origin of the large-scale swarming motions.
