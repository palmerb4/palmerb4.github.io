<h1 style="color: var(--global-heading-color);">Research Focus</h1>
What compels me most is the opportunity to augment scientific discovery through the targeted development, expansion, and reinforcement of computational infrastructure toward grand aims unreached by existing tools—infrastructure that accumulates value across time, across projects, and across generations of researchers. That style of long-form, mission-driven research—the kind that unfolds over decades in pursuit of grand challenges—is exemplified in national laboratories and independent research institutes. Their institutional breadth and sustained investment facilitate the conditions for programmatic research at a scale that lays the groundwork for discoveries still beyond reach. I will contribute to that mission.

This is what drew me to the Flatiron Institute and the Center for Computational Biology—an environment uniquely positioned to act as a centralized pillar of sustainable scientific infrastructure targeted at grand biological goals. For the past three years, I have worked to help realize this vision: reinforcing the systems I believed were necessary to make it possible. Aligned with CCB’s mission, my work has centered on building predictive frameworks capable of uncovering the mechanistic principles of systems too complex, too small, or too dynamic to be resolved by imaging alone—and too demanding for existing tools to capture in their full complexity. This effort has taken shape through the creation of new algorithms designed to strengthen the weak points of promising methodologies, and through the development of large-scale, performance-portable simulation libraries that offer capabilities absent from any existing framework.

Fast software is meaningless without fast algorithms; fast algorithms are meaningless if they violate experimental truth. Every layer, from physics to code, must align with the reality we seek to understand, lest the resulting models fail to be predictive; speed alone merely accelerates the arrival at the wrong answer. -->

Everything contained herein was made possible because of the generosity of one man: Dr. John Caldwell, a retired nuclear physicist whose support afforded me the opportunity to attend college, creating a path where none had existed.
